8. I modified the last paragraph of MIT license to sentence case because
UPPERCASE HURT FEELINGS. I don't want to hurt your feelings and get sued.
how sweet is that?

9. This software is actually provided as were,
because people don't make software like they used to be.

10. There should be no 4th section in this license, because fuck you four.

16. This license was not sponsored by NordVPN.

17. I... uh... kinda half-assed but hereby, I declare 'finishing' this on my 
23th birthday. so, happy birthday to myself and this software. it's more like 
'I'm not sure I can call it a day', than 'finished'. At least all the 
functions are working as I planned, (never said implemented as I intended!) 
and I never made such as useful as this nor expected to finish, so I'm freakin' 
ecstatic! anyway, as some say software rusts, and I'm sure I'd improve this over
time, so if this becomes awesome, please look this section as footprint 
from the past.

18. At the time I'm writing section 17, it's 4:05 am, mom is sleeping beside,
I'm tired, and there's more day to spend, so. If you're reading this, I'd say,
