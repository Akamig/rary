# rary

API library for my school library system.  

I made this library to automate extending book rental due. because their notify system always sends due date message day earlier. so I always get confused and miss the date, go to school which takes about an hour, just to returning and re-rent books. what a hassle.

Special thanks to ParkSB, for designing the-camp-lib which helped me grasp a basic concept of API Client, typescript usage, and I heavily referenced(i.e. shamelessly copied ) it.

## Install

## What can I do with this?

If you are in the same school as mine or using the same system, this library is for you!  
but I'm not gonna tell you which school I'm in!  

Anyway, you can do these.

- SSO Login (actually it's system-wide)
- Fetch Rented Book Data.
- **Extend Book Rental Due**  

Well, that's all. Of course there're many other functions in our library system. But I'm pretty sure those are easier on a browser, not console. And I don't even need 'em. so there's that.

Why the name 'rary'? because it's a library for library, so I was about to name it library-lib, but library-lib is rary!  
...sorry about the bad joke.
